                  heating, it&apos;s more than just uncomfortable - it can be

                </h5>
                <p>
                  While waiting for our technician to arrive, never attempt to
                  repair gas heating equipment yourself. Ensure adequate
                  ventilation if using alternative heating sources, and never
                  use camping stoves, BBQs, or car heaters indoors. If you smell
                  gas, turn off the gas supply at the meter and call us
                  immediately.
