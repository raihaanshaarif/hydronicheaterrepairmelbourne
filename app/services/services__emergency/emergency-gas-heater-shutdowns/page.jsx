                  Sometimes a hydronic heater needs to be immediately shut down for
                  safety reasons. Whether it&apos;s due to gas leaks, carbon
                  monoxide detection, unusual noises, or visible damage, our
                  emergency technicians are available 24/7 to safely isolate
                  dangerous gas heating equipment and protect your family from
                  harm.

                  When you call for emergency shutdown service, our technician
                  responds immediately with safety equipment and tools. We first
                  assess the immediate danger, then safely shut down the gas
                  supply and heating system. All electrical connections are also
                  safely disconnected if required.
                </p>
                <p className="indent__top">
                  After shutdown, we conduct a comprehensive safety inspection
                  to identify all potential hazards. We provide detailed
                  documentation of the problems found and explain what needs to
                  be done to restore safe operation. Your safety is our absolute
                  priority throughout this process.

                  What Happens After Emergency Shutdown?
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Once your heating system is safely shut down, we&apos;ll
                  discuss options for restoration. Some issues can be repaired
                  immediately, while others may require parts ordering or system
                  replacement. We can provide temporary heating advice and
                  prioritize permanent solutions.

                <p>
                  If your main heating system needs to be shut down, we&apos;ll
                  advise you on safe temporary heating options. We strongly
                  advise against using unvented hydronic heaters, camping equipment,
                  or car heaters indoors. Portable electric heaters are
                  typically the safest temporary solution.
